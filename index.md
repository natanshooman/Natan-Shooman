## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/natanshooman/NatanShoomanWebsite/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
This is my first website that's on the web. Welcome to my life. For the past 18 years, I've been exploring how to live a better, more interesting life. I've spent approximatly a fourth of that time on the computer or working on some other project that I've found to be interesting. I'm typing this now at about 70 WPM, now that I've learned how to type quickly. 
I've had a summer internship coding in JavaScript and runing physics experiments. I've also done a bit of work in Molecular Biology, throuh Pymol and PyRossetta. 
Outside of coding, I've been working on my Eagle Scout Application and I'm proud to have completed this past January. 

One my favorite things has always been reading guides to get inspiration and ideas for things to do. Here is my Mac OS Guide that I personally use whenever I'm working on a new computer: 


I'm strongly considering purchasing the new Macbook Air. I think that it will be much faster than even the 2000$ Macbook Pro i9 16" laptop that I've been thinking I'll need for college. Now that I've purchased an iPad Pro from B&H, I'm strongly considering getting the new M1, Macbook Air since it should be really fast for Xcode App design and for editing Videos using Final Cut Pro. The browswer will also be really fast right away. I'm convinced that the furture of Apple software will be done through XCode in a cross ipad Mac style. Apps will work on both platforms. 

I'm now working on pushing lots of code to the web that I'm going to be coding during my lunch break. 
Look forward to more comming soon. 


I've no strongly reconsided that option. Given the fact that I should be able to borrow a Macbook Pro 13 inch Intel laptop 2019 for Video editing and for using with Xcode and the fact that most applications are not yet optimized for the ARM platform, I may want to wait until more programs are optimised before purchasing.
