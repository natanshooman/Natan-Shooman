This is my first website that's on the web. Welcome to my life. For the past 18 years, I've been exploring how to live a better, more exciting life.
I've spent approximately a fifth of my time on the computer. I'm usually working on some sort of project that I've found to be interesting. It can be fun to learn something new or try out a new application. In the past few weeks, I've been working on typing. I'm typing this now at about 70 WPM, now that I've learned how to type quickly. 

### Technical Experience

I've had a summer internship coding in JavaScript and running physics experiments. I've also taken a COVID-19 Drug development course, which involved a bit of work in Molecular Biology, and computational protein folding done in PyMOL and PyRossetta. 
I've been working on my Eagle Scout Application outside of coding, and I'm proud to have completed it this past January. 

One of my favorite things has always been reading guides to get inspiration and ideas for something technical. I've done some IT consulting work in the community and built a desktop computer. My favorite Operating System is macOS and iPad OS. Here is my Mac OS Guide that I personally use whenever I'm working on a new computer: 


I'm strongly considering purchasing the new Macbook Air. I think that it will be much faster than even the 2000$ Macbook Pro i9 16" laptop that I've been thinking I'll need for college. Now that I've purchased an iPad Pro from B&H, I'm strongly considering getting the new M1, Macbook Air since it should be really swift for Xcode App design and for videos editing using Final Cut Pro. The browser will also be speedy, just like my iPad Pro. I'm convinced that Apple software's future will be done through XCode so that apps work well on iPhone, iPad, and with a few more features on Mac. 

I'm now working on pushing lots of code to the web that I will be coding during my lunch break. 
Look forward to more coming soon.
